# sm64-roblox extended

A fork of a [port of Super Mario 64's movement code into Roblox Luau](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/sm64-roblox) (in `--!strict` mode), hosted as a [rojo](https://rojo.space) project. Based on the SM64 decompilation project hosted at: https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64

Check out the main page of the wiki [here](https://github.com/Nobonet/sm64-roblox/wiki) to see what this fork has to offer.

## Setting Up & Disclaimers
This project follows standard rojo conventions. You should install vscode and install the rojo extension, as well as the rojo plugin for Roblox Studio.

Any bugs or behavioral quirks of the physics in this are intentional and will not be fixed. **No help will be provided for anything in here. It is NOT intended to be used as a foundation for new games and you're on your own if you choose to do so.**

## Terms of Use

You *may* use this in your game, **but you must provide credit** to this repository & the original repository from MaximumADHD and the SM64 Decompilation Project. I would **NOT** advise using it as a foundation for a platformer since it's very rigidly tied to the 30hz physics simulation code of Super Mario 64. It's weirdly programmed and not very intuitive to build off of.
